    Question 5: Your normalize implementation 

    Input factor is a single factor.

    The set of conditioned variables for the normalized factor consists 
    of the input factor's conditioned variables as well as any of the 
    input factor's unconditioned variab les with exactly one entry in their 
    domain.  Since there is only one entry in that variable's domain, we 
    can either assume it was assigned as evidence to have only one variable 
    in its domain, or it only had one entry in its domain to begin with.
    This blurs the distinction between evidence assignments and variables 
    with single value domains, but that is alright since we have to assign 
    variables that only have one value in their domain to that single value.

    Return a new factor where the sum of the all the probabilities in the table is 1.
    This should be a new factor, not a modification of this factor in place.

    If the sum of probabilities in the input factor is 0,
    you should return None.

    This is intended to be used at the end of a probabilistic inference query.
    Because of this, all variables that have more than one element in their
